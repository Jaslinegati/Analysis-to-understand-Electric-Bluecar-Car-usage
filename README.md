# sampling-and-hypothesis-testing
This work involves investigating the use of electric cars (blue cars) from the Autolib
dataset given.

Hypothesis testing is performed to help determine whether the variation between or between
data groups is due to true variation or the result of variation in the sample.

Hypothesis testing is used to infer from a larger population, the result of a hypothesis carried out
on sample data.

### Null Hypothesis:

Probability that the number of blue cars taken in one weekend is greater than
or equal to the probability of blue cars being returned the weekend

### Alternative Hypothesis: 

Probability that the number of blue cars taken in one weekend is less
than the probability of blue cars being returned in the weekend
